## Festival 3

###  Create area's, manage flags and run commmands attachted to area events. 

This version is in development.

Festival 3 is a new generation after [v2.1.3](https://github.com/genboy/Festival/releases/tag/2.1.3) 
(https://github.com/genboy/Festival)

Why? Well, the basic functions like area creation, attaching commands to events and some regular flags are really good, all other stuff including some flags and the menu UI causes a lot of trouble with other plugins and some basics in PMMP. I really like to make Festival work for everyone.

Version 3 will take some time to develop, but maybe not that long because it will be MODULAIR!

Yes, taking the best first, make it really stable and wide available and then start expanding the functionality, on demand.

Hope to find enough time soon to get this version up and running!
